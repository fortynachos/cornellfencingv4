                        December 3-4
                    <p>
                       The first weekend in December brought the entire fencing team, both Men’s and Women’s squads together to travel and fence at the Brandeis Invitational. It was a chance for the team to build and strengthen their growing camaraderie through the amazing efforts of Head Coach Daria Schneider. 
                    </p><p>
                       Saturday was a meet and greet at the Boston Marriott, Newton MA. Local alumni, coaches and team members had a chance to connect and get to know each other.
                    </p><p>
                       “I had an incredible time meeting David Creedon CALS ‘83 and Lindsey Anderson CHE ‘75 at the Boston Alumni Event. It was a treat to hear about their crazy road-trip experiences when they were Cornell Fencers. I'm sincerely thankful for their time and the opportunity to chat before our Brandeis tournament as it inspired us to do well the following day. Excited to meet more alumni at future events!” -Regina Chen, saber, junior
                    </p><p> 
                       "I enjoyed the alumni event as we discussed a wide variety of topics, from past fencing stories to career paths. I would love to talk to and get in touch with more alumni from all career backgrounds, not just those pertaining to my major, to form connections and learn about various career perspectives." -Kevin Wang, epee, freshman
                    </p><p>
                       The Brandeis Invitational was a chance to build on the growing strength of the team as a whole. It was well attended by family, alumni and friends. The women’s squad was able to break a losing streak by beating St. John’s, a feat that was last accomplished in 1992! They narrowly fell in the first round to UNC, 15-12, but came back to defeat the host Judges (19-8), MIT (21-6), Boston College (17-10) and the Red Storm (15-12). Overall and outstanding performance by the Big Red!
                    </p><p>
                       The men’s squad closed the day with a 2-3 record, clutching victories against Boston College (14-13) and Brandeis (16-11), with close-fought battles against UNC (10-17) MIT (9-18) and St. John’s (8-19). 
                    </p><p>
                       Alumni that came to the meet: Dr. Carol Englander ‘67, Nina Farouk CALS ‘97, Rob Hupp ‘78 (MIT Coach), Katie Hupp ‘78, and Harrison Fox SHA ‘14

                        October 1st 2016<br>
                        The Cornell Club, New York City<br>
                   <p>
                        Alumni, friends, family and student athletes joined CFA board members to welcome new Head Coach Daria Schneider and Assistant Coach Nicole Ross to the Cornell family of fencers.
                   </p><p>
                        It began with a wonderful cocktail hour giving us all a chance to meet, reunite and celebrate. The room was decorated with photos of past fencers as well as other memorabilia, and a slideshow showed photos spanning generations of Cornell Fencing. The entire group came together for a photo (which can be viewed above on the banner). 
                   </p><p>
                        After dinner, Valerie Leimer, CFA President, opened the evening with words of welcome and introduced our new coaches.
                   </p><p>
                        Coach Daria spoke of her past experiences, her excitement for this season and her vision for the future of fencing at Cornell. There was a sense of hope and renewed school spirit as she spoke of recent team-building programs, a clinic run by Olympians Nicole Ross and Soren Thompson (both present), and the inclusion of the Men's fencing club into the daily training with the Women's team. As a testament to that support, several of the current Men's club members were in attendance at the dinner as well. Coach Daria also talked about our initial steps towards  reinstating the Men's team to Varsity status, a goal that all present strongly supported. There is growing strength and unity within the entire team that should lead to a very successful season and a bright future for the program!

Matt had joined Opower as one of its first employees back in 2008, and he and I struck up a conversation at an alumni banquet about his job in software development and energy efficiency.  I found it fascinating.  Since I was a senior at the time, I applied shortly thereafter.<br>
                              I joined Opower in March of 2012, and have been happily employed there for four years.  I'm incredibly thankful for the networking opportunities that were afforded to me through Cornell Fencing.  Matt and I were also joined later by Nick Heiner '12, and celebrated Matt's referrals with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFo5-nuGpps" target="_blank">fence-off</a> in the office.  I wouldn't have heard about Opower if it weren't for Cornell Fencing.

                       <h3>History of Cornell Fencing</h3>
                       <p>
                           Since 1894, Cornell students who love the sport of fencing have met on campus. What started as a small club, grew into a powerhouse in the first half of the 20th Century that’s evolved into one of the finest programs in the country.
                           <br><br>
                           Fencing officially became a varsity sport at Cornell in 1898, and the University fielded a men’s team every year through 1992-93, except for a six-year hiatus from 1917-23. A women’s fencing club was established in 1926 and Cornell was almost immediately competitive in intercollegiate meets. In 1929, the first Intercollegiate Women’s Fencing Association championship tournament was held at Cornell, and by 1930, the Big Red had claimed the national crown.

                       <h3>Cornell Fencing Association History</h3>
                       <p class="assignments-bullet-text">
                           The Cornell Fencing Association was founded on April 2, 2015 by a group of Cornell fencers and alumni, in partnership with the Athletic Department, Coaching Staff,  and the Athletic Alumni Affairs Department. The CFA was established to encourage, promote, and support the fencing program at Cornell University. We look to assist Cornell University in creating an environment to enhance student athletes’ lives, in accordance with the mission and goals of Cornell, the Athletic Department, and the NCAA through networking, financial support, mentorship, and other means.

                       </p>
                       <h3>Men’s Team History</h3>
                       <p class="services-bullet-text">
                           The men’s team became a national power in the 1930s when Georges Cointe became head coach. Cointe turned out successful teams during his entire reign as Cornell coach, and his 1955 team was IFA epee and three-weapon champion. Richard Pew ‘55 was the national runner-up in 1955 and he placed fourth in the 1956 Olympics.
                           <br><br>
                           Raoul Sudre ’60 continued the rich tradition of Big Red fencing when he served as coach from 1961-1976. Sudre was named Coach of the Year three times by both the NCAA and NIWFA and in 1975 led the men to a second-place finish at the national championships.
                           <br><br>
                           In the mid-1970s, Cornell experienced success within the Ivy League that it had not achieved before and has not matched since. Cornell tied for first in the Ivy League in 1974, 1975 and 1977, compiling the second best record at the Ivy League Championships between ‘74 and ‘77 (one victory behind UPenn’s 14-6 record).
                           <br><br>
                           In 1993, the Men lost their varsity status and continued competing as a club in the Middle Atlantic Collegiate Fencing Association (MACFA) and in the United States Association of Collegiate Fencing Clubs (USACFC). Since 1993, Cornell has won the USACFC Foil title 3 times, the MACFA foil title 4 times, and the USACFC National Title Once.

                       <p class="services-bullet-text">
                           The women enjoyed national titles from 1967-69 under the direction of Michel Sebastiani and in 1972 and 1973 under Sudre. Karen Denton ‘68 took the IWFA individual title as a senior, while Peggy Walbridge ‘74 was a three-time All-American who won the national title in her final season.
                           <br><br>
                           Jean-Jacques Gillet, assistant coach since 1970, became head coach in 1977. The women’s squad went 13-0 and placed second in the NIWFA tournament in 1977, finished fourth at the AIAW championships in 1982 and placed seventh at the NCAA championships in 1983.
                           <br><br>
                           Cornell once more returned to the top of the fencing world when it won back-to-back NIWFA championships in 1991 and 1992.
