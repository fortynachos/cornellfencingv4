                   <h4>Notice of Proposed Changes to CFA Bylaws</h4>
                    <p>February 12, 2018</p>
                
                    <p>As the CFA continues to grow and evolve, we find that it is necessary, from time to time, to make adjustments to our <a href="http://cornellfencingassociation.com/resources/Fencing-CFA_ByLaws-2.17%20(002)-signed.pdf">Bylaws</a>. For the past several months, the Board has considered making a few limited changes to the Bylaws to streamline our governance processes and reflect changes to the Board’s organizational structure. Accordingly, as required by Article X.B, we are providing CFA members with thirty days’ notice of these proposed changes. The specific changes we are proposing are the following:</p>
                        
                    <p>1. That Paragraph V.A.3 shall be amended from, “The following information shall, at a minimum be presented to the membership at annual meetings….” to “The following information shall, when applicable, be presented to the membership at annual meetings:”</p>
                        
                    <p>2. That Paragraph V.B.1 shall be amended from, “The Board of Directors shall hold quarterly meetings, at a time and place to be determined by the Board.” to “The Board of Directors shall, at a minimum, hold quarterly meetings at a time and place to be determined by the Board.”</p>
                        
                    <p>3. That Paragraph VII.I.2. shall be amended to reduce the time period required between the election of Board members and Officers and the annual meeting, such that “Elections shall occur at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the annual meeting, and the results shall be announced at the annual meeting.” shall now read, “Elections shall occur at no less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the annual meeting, and the results shall be announced as soon as practicable.”</p>
                        
                    <p>4. That, pursuant to Paragraph VIII, the Board hereby dissolves the Mentorship Committee.</p>
                        
                   <p>If no significant opposition to these changes is expressed by the membership during the comment period, we will move to formally approve these amendments so that they may take effect by the Spring Meeting. The full resolution can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDq8JvI_i69Yjr25FwqzCNb-xxDIUFrylim0Mm9x2DQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. For further information, or to provide your comments, please contact the Nomination and Elections Committee at <a href="mailto:nominating@cornellfencingassociation.com">nominating@cornellfencingassociation.com</a>.</p>
                   
                   <h4>Third Annual Cornell Fencing Association Fall Dinner</h4>

                   <img class="news-img" src="images/Cornell20180915Fencing.jpg" alt="Coaches and Guests" />

                   <p>September 15, 2018 at the New York Athletic Club</p>

                   <p>Alumni, Olympians, World Team members and Olympic Coaches wined, dined and some even fenced the night away at our 3rd Annual CFA Fall Dinner. In what portends to be a winning season ahead, Head Coach Daria Schneider, the evening&#x2019;s MC,  introduced us to Cornell&#x2019;s newest coach, Omar Elgeziry. A 2016 Olympian himself, he was previously assistant coach at Air Force for 3 seasons and coached 11 athletes into qualifying positions in the NCAA. He also spent one year as the national epee coach for the USA Pentathlon. We welcome him to the Cornell family.</p>
                   
                   <p>We also said our farewell to Nicole Ross, who is taking a leave of absence to prepare for qualification to the 2020 Olympic Team.  As current world champion, we know she will continue to build on her success. She spoke about her enjoyment with working with the team and being a member of the Cornell fencing family. We wish her all the best! </p>
                   
                   <p>Board Member and past President of the CFA, Valerie Leimer gave an impassioned speech revealing her personal reason for contributing so generously to the reinstatement effort. We ask that all fencing alumni look for their reason, their most personal &#x201C;why&#x201D;, to contribute towards this goal. A unified Men&#x2019;s and Women&#x2019;s team brings more than just all IVY titles, but a camaraderie that is unique to NCAA sports.</p>
                   
                   <p>We welcomed our honored guests Greg Massialas and Buckie Leach who shared stories of their time at Cornell as well as their experience working with both Daria and Nicole. They wished for the continued success of the Cornell fencing program and included their support of a future reinstated men&#x2019;s team.</p>
                   
                   <p>The night ended with a fencing expo with Omar Elgeziry fencing epee against Jake Hoyle on a fencing strip that spanned the front of the room. Jake Hoyle is a two time NCAA champion who competed recently in the Senior World Championships Wuxi, China 2018 and is the number one ranked epee fencer in the United States. The rousing bout brought out cheers and laughter that ended the evening at the New York Athletic Club in true Cornell style! You can see additional photos and watch video of speeches from Daria, Val, Bucky, and Greg along the Omar and Jake fencing at our <a href="https://cornellfencing.smugmug.com/2018-NYC-Fall-Dinner-photos/">SmugMug ablum</a> for the dinner.</p>
                   
                   <p>We look forward to seeing you this Spring 2019 for the Alumni Tournament and Banquet on May 4th 2019 in Ithaca, New York.</p>
                   
                    <h4>CFA 2018 Board of Directors Election</h4>
                    <p>January 15, 2018</p>
                
                    <p>The Cornell Fencing Association is preparing for its 2018 election for the CFA Board of Directors.

                   <h4>Second Annual Cornell Fencing Association Fall Dinner</h4>
                   <img class="news-img" src="images/2017FallDinner.jpg" alt="Coaches with the 1967 Champions" />
                   <img class="news-img" src="images/2017FallDinnerOldTeam.jpg" alt="Original 1967 Champions Photo" />

                   <p>September 23, 2017</p>

                   <p>The Cornell fencing community came together at the Cornell Club in Manhattan to celebrate the 1967 Women&#x2019;s Foil team and the 50th anniversary of their national championship win under Coach Michel Sebastiani. The entire team along with their coach were inducted into the 1894 Society.</p>
                   
                   <p>Attended by Captain Carol Marcus Englander &#x2019;67, Karen Denton Smith &#x2019;68, Sally Nellis Kuehl &#x2019;67, and their coach, Maitre Michel Sebastiani, the CFA reunited the 1967 foil family with the greater Cornell Fencing Family in attendance. After an introduction by Matt Laks &#x2019;15, each team member had an opportunity to speak on the growth of the team in those early years as well as to reflect on where the experiences of being a part of the Cornell team has brought them today. They uniformly gave thanks to the coach that was able to see their potential. In the words of Suzanne Gearhart &#x2019;68, who was unable to attend, “He taught us, he encouraged us, he pushed us and above all he made fencing not just a sport but also and more important a discipline, a calling and even an intellectual activity. I know I was hooked from the very first class.” Coach Michel Sebastiani then reflected on his experiences at Cornell where he not only developed and trained championship fencers but made them into a family.</p>
                   
                   <p>After dinner, Head Coach Daria Schneider welcomed us into the 2017-2018 season with her vision for the year to come for both the Women&#x2019;s and Men&#x2019;s squads. The competitive schedule kicks off in November with the Ohio State Invitational.  Andrew Stifel &#x2019;91 spoke on the efforts towards Men&#x2019;s team reinstatement and Joe Kirk &#x2019;86 encouraged the audience to participate in the CFA Mentorship program which will start to recruit new mentors and mentees in October. This year there is an opportunity for young alumni to function as mentees as well as mentors. President Barbara Todd Heiner &#x2019;81 closed the evening with thanks to all who helped make the program a success. Since its inception, there has been a growth in both numbers of active CFA members and attendance at this event. It is the strength of our growing community that supports our student athletes at Cornell!</p>

                   <img class="news-img" src="images/2017AlumniTourney.jpg" alt="Alumni, Family And Current Fencers" />

                   <p>May 6, 2017</p>
                   
                   <p>Bringing together Cornell fencers of multiple generations, the Alumni Tournament and Spring Banquet was a successful weekend of events. The CFA annual board meeting was followed by a welcome breakfast at the Stifel salle. It was a carb loading experience that gave alumni an opportunity to get to know the current team before a tournament that would pit them against each other.</p>
                   
                   <p>This year Coach Schneider reintroduced the alumni tournament with the winners&#x2019; names being immortalized on the perpetual trophy, last engraved in 1992. Teams of three weapons each, consisting of a mix of student athletes, alumni and friends, fenced in two pools to identify the top teams who would battle in a final for the ultimate prize. Team Rocks lead by alumnus Adam Kirsch BS &#x2019;15 MBA &#x2019;16, epee, Owen Sconzo &#x2019;18, foil, and Kat Kudryashov &#x2019;19, saber, were the tournament champions.</p>
                    <img class="news-img" src="images/2017AlumniTourneyWinners.jpg" alt="Adam, Owen and Kat, with their trophy" />

                   <p>The evening&#x2019;s banquet was held at the spacious new Ithaca Marriott Downtown on the Ithaca Commons. The formal event was held in honor of Georges Cointe who was inducted in the Cornell Fencing 1894 Society, our hall of fame. Three alumni, David Jordan &#x2019;62, Ritchie Thomas &#x2019;59 and Laszlo Szerenyi &#x2019;62, presented vignettes on their experience fencing for this illustrious Coach, who served as head coach from 1935 to 1961. A commemorative trophy was then presented to a member of Georges Cointe&#x2019;s family, Marilyn Abbott. Senior speeches by Victoria Wines, Abby Forth and Jake Silverman followed with each giving much heartfelt thanks for the experience of the last four years. Winning the Georges L. Cointe Award were Lubi Kiriakidi &#x2019;17 and Michael Maurer &#x2019;18, the Graeme Jenning Award went to Abby Forth &#x2019;17 and Grant Ubelele &#x2019;20 and the Academic Excellence Award went to Lubi Kiraikidi &#x2019;17 and Owen Sconzo &#x2019;19.</p>
                   <p>For those who missed a chance to reunite with old friends and meet new, you are invited to our Fall Banquet Honoring the 1967 Women&#x2019;s Championship Team, September 23, 2017 at the Cornell Club in New York City. <a href="http://cornelluniversity.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&gid=2&pgid=9077&content_id=9447">Register here.</a></p>

                       <h3>History of Cornell Fencing</h3>
                       <p>
                           Since 1894, Cornell students who love the sport of fencing have met on campus. What started as a small club, grew into a powerhouse in the first half of the 20th Century that&#x2019;s evolved into one of the finest programs in the country.
                           <br><br>
                           Fencing officially became a varsity sport at Cornell in 1898, and the University fielded a men&#x2019;s team every year through 1992-93, except for a six-year hiatus from 1917-23. A women&#x2019;s fencing club was established in 1926 and Cornell was almost immediately competitive in intercollegiate meets. In 1929, the first Intercollegiate Women&#x2019;s Fencing Association championship tournament was held at Cornell, and by 1930, the Big Red had claimed the national crown.

                       <p class="assignments-bullet-text">
                           The Cornell Fencing Association was founded on April 2, 2015 by a group of Cornell fencers and alumni, in partnership with the Athletic Department, Coaching Staff,  and the Athletic Alumni Affairs Department. The CFA was established to encourage, promote, and support the fencing program at Cornell University. We look to assist Cornell University in creating an environment to enhance student athletes&#x2019; lives, in accordance with the mission and goals of Cornell, the Athletic Department, and the NCAA through networking, financial support, mentorship, and other means.

                       <h3>Men&#x2019;s Team History</h3>
                       <p class="services-bullet-text">
                           The men&#x2019;s team became a national power in the 1930s when Georges Cointe became head coach. Cointe turned out successful teams during his entire reign as Cornell coach, and his 1955 team was IFA epee and three-weapon champion. Richard Pew &#x2019;55 was the national runner-up in 1955 and he placed fourth in the 1956 Olympics.
                           <br><br>
                           Raoul Sudre &#x2019;60 continued the rich tradition of Big Red fencing when he served as coach from 1961-1976. Sudre was named Coach of the Year three times by both the NCAA and NIWFA and in 1975 led the men to a second-place finish at the national championships.
                           <br><br>
                           In the mid-1970s, Cornell experienced success within the Ivy League that it had not achieved before and has not matched since. Cornell tied for first in the Ivy League in 1974, 1975 and 1977, compiling the second best record at the Ivy League Championships between &#x2019;74 and &#x2019;77 (one victory behind UPenn&#x2019;s 14-6 record).
                           <br><br>
                           In 1993, the Men lost their varsity status and continued competing as a club in the Middle Atlantic Collegiate Fencing Association (MACFA) and in the United States Association of Collegiate Fencing Clubs (USACFC). Since 1993, Cornell has won the USACFC Foil title 3 times, the MACFA foil title 4 times, and the USACFC National Title Once.

                       <h3>Women&#x2019;s Team History</h3>
                       <p class="services-bullet-text">
                           The women enjoyed national titles from 1967-69 under the direction of Michel Sebastiani and in 1972 and 1973 under Sudre. Karen Denton &#x2019;68 took the IWFA individual title as a senior, while Peggy Walbridge &#x2019;74 was a three-time All-American who won the national title in her final season.
                           <br><br>
                           Jean-Jacques Gillet, assistant coach since 1970, became head coach in 1977. The women&#x2019;s squad went 13-0 and placed second in the NIWFA tournament in 1977, finished fourth at the AIAW championships in 1982 and placed seventh at the NCAA championships in 1983.
                           <br><br>
                           Cornell once more returned to the top of the fencing world when it won back-to-back NIWFA championships in 1991 and 1992.
